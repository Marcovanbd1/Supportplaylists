      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <h2>People speak in fragments. Systems expect forms.</h2>
      <p>
        When life gets heavy or confusing, people rarely speak in neat categories. They speak in fragments, feelings and half formed thoughts.
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        "I am tired all the time. I keep dropping the ball. I feel like I am letting everyone down and I do not know what to fix first."
      </p>
      <p>
        Most digital tools ask people to translate that into the system's language. Pick a topic. Choose a symptom. Select a journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Support Playlists starts from the opposite direction. The person talks the way they normally do. The system takes on the work of understanding and shaping a response.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section alt">
      <h3>The pattern</h3>
      <h2>From raw language to a small set of next steps</h2>
      <p>
        Support Playlists is a pattern for how a system can respond when someone describes what is going on in their own words. It does not diagnose. It does not score. It simply offers a tiny, structured path.
      </p>
      <div class="grid" style="margin-top: 6px;">
        <div>
          <p class="label">Input</p>
          <p>
            Natural speech or text. Messy, emotional and unstructured. No tags. No labels. Just what someone would say if you asked "How are you, really?"
          </p>
          <p class="label" style="margin-top: 10px;">Understanding</p>
          <p>
            A model infers a little about emotional colour, energy level and time pressure. It is not trying to name a condition. It is only trying to be kind and proportionate.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="label">Output</p>
          <p>
            A Support Playlist. Four short pieces.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tonight</strong> - one grounding action that fits their state</li>
            <li><strong>Next</strong> - one realistic step over the coming days</li>
            <li><strong>Support</strong> - one way to widen the circle around them</li>
            <li><strong>Escalate</strong> - one clear suggestion if things get worse</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Small enough to remember. Gentle enough to act on. Clear enough to be safe.
          </p>
        </div>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>The discipline</h3>
      <h2>Emotional Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        Support Playlists sits on a design discipline we call <strong>Emotional Architecture</strong>. It treats conversations with an intelligent system as emotional spaces that need structure, not just logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emotional Architecture asks questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How does a system acknowledge what someone has said without pretending to feel in the way a human would</li>
        <li>What tone feels steady and reassuring rather than chirpy or cold</li>
        <li>How much suggestion is helpful before it becomes pressure or noise</li>
        <li>Where are the hard edges of scope, and how can you say no without breaking trust</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In technical terms, Emotional Architecture is a set of constraints, grammars and safety rules that sit around a model. In human terms, it is what makes an agent feel like a calm, clearly bounded presence rather than another demanding interface.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section alt">
      <h3>Where it fits</h3>
      <h2>A non clinical layer for everyday uncertainty</h2>
      <p>
        Support Playlists is not a clinical tool. It is not a triage engine and it does not belong inside diagnostic pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a non clinical navigation layer that can sit:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>around wellbeing and self care products</li>
        <li>inside neighbourhood or community platforms</li>
        <li>next to mental health content without trying to be therapy</li>
        <li>in any setting where people arrive with "something is wrong, but I am not sure what"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The focus is simple. Help people feel a little less alone and a little more oriented, before they decide what to do next.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Safety and scope</h3>
      <h2>What it does not do</h2>
      <p>
        The safest part of Support Playlists is the role it refuses to play.
      </p>
      <p><strong>It does not:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>diagnose or label conditions</li>
        <li>interpret or score symptoms</li>
        <li>replace professional judgement</li>
        <li>promise crisis support or emergency response</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Instead, it:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>works from a bounded, verified set of resources and ideas</li>
        <li>keeps suggestions small, concrete and reversible</li>
        <li>uses simple, inspectable structures like "Tonight, Next, Support, Escalate"</li>
        <li>stays honest about what it can and cannot hold</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section alt">
      <h3>State of the work</h3>
      <h2>Early, real and still unfolding</h2>
      <p>
        Support Playlists is not a finished product. It is an active piece of work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is a small prototype running in one local area, using real services and content.</li>
        <li>The pattern has been tested with non clinical scenarios first.</li>
        <li>The emotional and safety boundaries are being shaped with practitioners in mind.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The work moves quickly at the conceptual layer. The open question, which we are honest about, is how to scale a pattern like this responsibly and in partnership with others.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h3>Who is behind it</h3>
      <h2>Origins and team</h2>
      <p>
        Support Playlists and Emotional Architecture are being developed in the south of England by Mark Winterburn, whose background is in psychology, political philosophy and storytelling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideas are shaped within a small circle of people who have known each other since childhood, a clinical psychologist, a nurse and a social worker. That long standing trust and multidisciplinary mix helps keep the work grounded in real life rather than abstract theory.
      </p>

      <h3>Invitation</h3>
      <h2>For collaborators, partners and critics</h2>
      <p>
        If you are working on personal intelligence, wellbeing products, neighbourhood support or new navigation layers, you may recognise some of the patterns described here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are interested in conversations with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>people building agents or conversational systems who care about emotional safety</li>
        <li>teams exploring non clinical support around health, work or money</li>
        <li>researchers and designers who share an interest in how people express uncertainty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
